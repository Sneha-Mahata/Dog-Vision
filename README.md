# Dog Vision Project: Dog Breed Identification

* Objective: Developed an end-to-end multi-class image classifier to identify dog breeds using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.
* Dataset: Utilized a canine subset of ImageNet with 120 dog breeds for fine-grained image categorization.
* Model: Implemented MobileNet_V2 for training the classifier.
* Challenge: Tackled the problem with a limited number of training images per class.
* Results: Achieved impressive accuracy in predicting dog breeds on a custom dataset of personally clicked dog photos.
* Skills Gained: Deep learning, TensorFlow, image classification, fine-grained categorization, and practical implementation of neural networks.
